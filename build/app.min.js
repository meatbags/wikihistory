A [[spiritual successor]] to FromSoftware's ''[[Demon's Souls]]'', the game is an installment in the ''[[Souls (series)|Souls]]'' series of games. It was released for [[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox 360]], and [[Microsoft Windows]] in Japan by FromSoftware in September 2011, and worldwide by Namco Bandai Games the following month.\\n\\nIn August 2012, the \\\"Prepare to Die\\\" edition of ''Dark Souls'' was released for Windows, featuring additional content previously unavailable to PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 users. In October 2012, the additional content from the Windows version was released as downloadable content for consoles under the subtitle ''Artorias of the Abyss''. ''Dark Souls'' takes place in the fictional kingdom of Lordran, where players assume the role of a cursed undead character who begins a [[pilgrimage]] to discover the fate of their kind.\\n\\n''Dark Souls'' received critical acclaim upon its release and is considered to be one of the [[List of video games considered the best|best video games ever made]], with critics praising the depth of its combat, intricate level design, and world lore. However, the game's difficulty received mixed reviews. While some praised the challenge it provides, others criticized it for being unnecessarily unforgiving. The PC version of the game was less well-received, with criticism directed at numerous technical issues. By April 2013, the game had sold over two million copies worldwide. A sequel, ''[[Dark Souls II]]'', was released in 2014, while a remastered version will be released for [[Nintendo Switch]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], and [[Microsoft Windows]] in May 2018.\\n\\n==Gameplay==\\n[[File:Darksoulsbattle.jpg|thumb|left|The [[player character]] (right) battling Knight Artorias, one of the bosses added to the game through downloadable content.]]\\n''Dark Souls'' is a third-person [[action role-playing game]]. The core mechanic of the game is exploration. Players are encouraged by the game to proceed with caution, learn from past mistakes, or find alternate areas to explore. ''Dark Souls'' takes place in a large and continuous [[open world]] environment, connected through a central hub area (Firelink Shrine). Players are able to travel to and from areas and explore various paths at will, although certain prerequisites have to be met in order to unlock certain areas.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/10/03/dark-souls-review-brick-walls-and-pancakes/ |title=Dark Souls review: Brick walls and pancakes |work=Engadget |date=October 3, 2011 |accessdate=September 10, 2016 |first=Richard |last=Mitchell}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://m.ign.com/articles/2011/09/30/dark-souls-review |title=Dark Souls Review |work=IGN |date=September 30, 2011 |accessdate=September 10, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/dark_souls/b/ps3/archive/2011/10/03/dark-souls-review-dead-and-loving-it.aspx |title=Dark Souls Review: Dead And Loving It |work=GameInformer.com |date=October 3, 2011 |accessdate=September 10, 2016 |first=Phil |last=Kollar}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://m.gamerevolution.com/review/dark-souls |title=Dark Souls Review |work=Game Revolution |date=October 3, 2011 |accessdate=September 10, 2016 |first=Daniel |last=Bischoff}}</ref>\\n\\nCentral to ''Dark Souls'' are [[Bonfire (Dark Souls)|Bonfires]]. Bonfires are scattered throughout the world and serve as checkpoints for each level.  When rested at, the player is healed to full, healing charges are restored, but all of the enemies (except for bosses, mini-bosses, and specific characters) respawn. While resting, players can level up and perform other key functions.\\n\\nAnother aspect of ''Dark Souls'' is the \\\"humanity\\\" system. There are two \\\"forms\\\" the player character can be in during the game, human form and hollow form.  Whenever the player dies in human form, they are returned to hollow form and can only have their humanity restored by consuming an item (also called a \\\"humanity\\\").  In order to gain the assistance of other players, the player must be in human form.  While in human form, the player is subjected to invasions by other players and NPCs who seek to kill the player and restore their own humanity.\\n\\nHumanity can be acquired in many ways, and if no humanity is available, players are still able to progress in hollow form. Death in either form results in the loss of all carried souls and humanity, but players revive as hollows at their most recent bonfire with one chance at returning to where they died to recover all lost souls and humanity. If the player dies before reaching their \\\"bloodstain\\\", the souls and humanity they previously accrued are permanently lost.\\n\\nCommunication between players is deliberately limited. Besides character gestures, the only other communication players have with one another comes by way of orange [[soapstone]]s, which allow players to write limited messages that can be read by others in the same area.\\n\\nThroughout the game, there are multiple [[non-playable characters]] the player may encounter on their journey. These characters add to the plot of the game but are not mandatory to engage with. If the player does choose to engage with them, the characters are able to assist the player by being able to be summoned for certain boss fights.\\n\\n==Plot==\\n''Dark Souls'' has a [[minimalism|minimalistic]] plot. Historical events in this world and their significance are often implicit and left to player interpretation rather than fully shown or explained. Most of the story is given to the player through dialogue from characters within the game, [[flavor text]] from items, and world design.\\n\\nThe opening cutscene establishes the premise of the game. Long ago during the Age of Ancients, the world was shrouded by grey fog and ruled by dragons. In this time period, a powerful mystic fire known as the First Flame erupts from the earth and brings with it souls, the essence of all life. The Lord Souls, the most powerful of the souls, were claimed by the first Lords, Gravelord Nito, the Witch of Izaleth, and Gwyn who use their power to defeat the dragons and build great kingdoms, beginning the Age of Fire. Over time, the flames begin to fade with the rise of humans, and Gwyn sacrifices himself and his soul to prolong the Age of Fire. With the flame artificially rekindled, the Undead Curse begins to plague humanity, causing certain humans to continually resurrect upon death.\\n\\nThe player character is a cursed undead, locked away in an undead asylum. After escaping the asylum, the player travels to Lordran to ring the Bells of Awakening, where they meet undead from other worlds, such as [[Solaire of Astora]]. The bells awaken Kingseeker Frampt, who tells the player to brave [[Sen's Fortress]] and ascend to [[Anor Londo]]. In Anor Londo, Gwynevere instructs the player to succeed Lord Gwyn and fulfill the prophecy. To accomplish this, the Lord Souls must be acquired from all the Lords and returned to the flame.\\n\\nThe player may encounter Darkstalker Kaathe, who encourages the player not to link the fire but to let it die out and usher in the Age of Dark. Once the player acquires the Lord Souls, they travel to the Kiln of the First Flame to succeed Lord Gwyn. Once Gwyn has been defeated, the player is given the choice of linking the flame to prolong the Age of Fire, or letting it die out to instigate the Age of Dark.\\n\\n=== ''Artorias of the Abyss'' ===\\nAt some point in the past, a being known as Manus awoke and began to spread the Abyss—an expanse of darkness—over the land of Oolacile. Knight Artorias was sent to Oolacile to stop the spread of the Abyss, but he failed and became corrupted, sacrificing himself to protect his companion [[Sif, the Great Grey Wolf|Sif]]. Meanwhile, Manus searches desperately for his long-lost pendant across space and time. Once the player obtains the pendant, Manus pulls them into the past. There, the player destroys the corrupted Artorias, and defeats Manus, halting the spread of the Abyss.\\n\\n==Development and release==\\n{{Expand section|date=August 2016}}\\n\\n''Dark Souls'' was developed by [[FromSoftware]], with series creator [[Hidetaka Miyazaki]] leading the project's development.\\n\\nFollowing the game's release for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, many gamers expressed their hope for a PC version.

[[action role-playing game|action role-playing]] [[video game]] developed by [[FromSoftware]] and published by [[Namco Bandai Games]] for [[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox 360]], and [[Microsoft Windows]]. A [[spiritual successor]] to FromSoftware's ''[[Demon's Souls]]'', it is the second installment in the ''[[Souls (series)|Souls]]'' series of games. The game was self-published and released in Japan in September 2011, and worldwide by Namco Bandai Games the following month.\\n\\nIn August 2012, the \\\"Prepare to Die\\\" edition of ''Dark Souls'' was released for Windows, featuring additional content previously unavailable to PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 users. In October 2012, the additional content from the Windows version was released as downloadable content for consoles under the subtitle ''Artorias of the Abyss''. ''Dark Souls'' takes place in the fictional kingdom of Lordran, where players assume the role of a cursed undead character who begins a [[pilgrimage]] to discover the fate of their kind.\\n\\n''Dark Souls'' received critical acclaim upon its release and is considered to be one of the [[List of video games considered the best|best video games ever made]], with critics praising the depth of its combat, intricate level design, and world lore. However, the game's difficulty received mixed reviews. While some praised the challenge it provides, others criticized it for being unnecessarily unforgiving. The PC version of the game was less well-received, with criticism directed at numerous technical issues. By April 2013, the game had sold over two million copies worldwide. A sequel, ''[[Dark Souls II]]'', was released in 2014, while a remastered version will be released for [[Nintendo Switch]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], and [[Microsoft Windows]] in May 2018.\\n\\n==Gameplay==\\n[[File:Darksoulsbattle.jpg|thumb|left|The [[player character]] (right) battling Knight Artorias, one of the bosses added to the game through downloadable content.]]\\n''Dark Souls'' is a third-person [[action role-playing game]]. The core mechanic of the game is exploration. Players are encouraged by the game to proceed with caution, learn from past mistakes, or find alternate areas to explore. ''Dark Souls'' takes place in a large and continuous [[open world]] environment, connected through a central hub area (Firelink Shrine). Players are able to travel to and from areas and explore various paths at will, although certain prerequisites have to be met in order to unlock certain areas.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/10/03/dark-souls-review-brick-walls-and-pancakes/ |title=Dark Souls review: Brick walls and pancakes |work=Engadget |date=October 3, 2011 |accessdate=September 10, 2016 |first=Richard |last=Mitchell}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://m.ign.com/articles/2011/09/30/dark-souls-review |title=Dark Souls Review |work=IGN |date=September 30, 2011 |accessdate=September 10, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/dark_souls/b/ps3/archive/2011/10/03/dark-souls-review-dead-and-loving-it.aspx |title=Dark Souls Review: Dead And Loving It |work=GameInformer.com |date=October 3, 2011 |accessdate=September 10, 2016 |first=Phil |last=Kollar}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://m.gamerevolution.com/review/dark-souls |title=Dark Souls Review |work=Game Revolution |date=October 3, 2011 |accessdate=September 10, 2016 |first=Daniel |last=Bischoff}}</ref>\\n\\nCentral to ''Dark Souls'' are [[Bonfire (Dark Souls)|Bonfires]]. Bonfires are scattered throughout the world and serve as checkpoints for each level.  When rested at, the player is healed to full, healing charges are restored, but all of the enemies (except for bosses, mini-bosses, and specific characters) respawn. While resting, players can level up and perform other key functions.\\n\\nAnother aspect of ''Dark Souls'' is the \\\"humanity\\\" system. There are two \\\"forms\\\" the player character can be in during the game, human form and hollow form.  Whenever the player dies in human form, they are returned to hollow form and can only have their humanity restored by consuming an item (also called a \\\"humanity\\\").  In order to gain the assistance of other players, the player must be in human form.  While in human form, the player is subjected to invasions by other players and NPCs who seek to kill the player and restore their own humanity.\\n\\nHumanity can be acquired in many ways, and if no humanity is available, players are still able to progress in hollow form. Death in either form results in the loss of all carried souls and humanity, but players revive as hollows at their most recent bonfire with one chance at returning to where they died to recover all lost souls and humanity. If the player dies before reaching their \\\"bloodstain\\\", the souls and humanity they previously accrued are permanently lost.\\n\\nCommunication between players is deliberately limited. Besides character gestures, the only other communication players have with one another comes by way of orange [[soapstone]]s, which allow players to write limited messages that can be read by others in the same area.\\n\\nThroughout the game, there are multiple [[non-playable characters]] the player may encounter on their journey. These characters add to the plot of the game but are not mandatory to engage with. If the player does choose to engage with them, the characters are able to assist the player by being able to be summoned for certain boss fights.\\n\\n==Plot==\\n''Dark Souls'' has a [[minimalism|minimalistic]] plot. Historical events in this world and their significance are often implicit and left to player interpretation rather than fully shown or explained. Most of the story is given to the player through dialogue from characters within the game, [[flavor text]] from items, and world design.\\n\\nThe opening cutscene establishes the premise of the game. Long ago during the Age of Ancients, the world was shrouded by grey fog and ruled by dragons. In this time period, a powerful mystic fire known as the First Flame erupts from the earth and brings with it souls, the essence of all life. The Lord Souls, the most powerful of the souls, were claimed by the first Lords, Gravelord Nito, the Witch of Izaleth, and Gwyn who use their power to defeat the dragons and build great kingdoms, beginning the Age of Fire. Over time, the flames begin to fade with the rise of humans, and Gwyn sacrifices himself and his soul to prolong the Age of Fire. With the flame artificially rekindled, the Undead Curse begins to plague humanity, causing certain humans to continually resurrect upon death.\\n\\nThe player character is a cursed undead, locked away in an undead asylum. After escaping the asylum, the player travels to Lordran to ring the Bells of Awakening, where they meet undead from other worlds, such as [[Solaire of Astora]]. The bells awaken Kingseeker Frampt, who tells the player to brave [[Sen's Fortress]] and ascend to [[Anor Londo]]. In Anor Londo, Gwynevere instructs the player to succeed Lord Gwyn and fulfill the prophecy. To accomplish this, the Lord Souls must be acquired from all the Lords and returned to the flame.\\n\\nThe player may encounter Darkstalker Kaathe, who encourages the player not to link the fire but to let it die out and usher in the Age of Dark. Once the player acquires the Lord Souls, they travel to the Kiln of the First Flame to succeed Lord Gwyn. Once Gwyn has been defeated, the player is given the choice of linking the flame to prolong the Age of Fire, or letting it die out to instigate the Age of Dark.\\n\\n=== ''Artorias of the Abyss'' ===\\nAt some point in the past, a being known as Manus awoke and began to spread the Abyss—an expanse of darkness—over the land of Oolacile. Knight Artorias was sent to Oolacile to stop the spread of the Abyss, but he failed and became corrupted, sacrificing himself to protect his companion [[Sif, the Great Grey Wolf|Sif]]. Meanwhile, Manus searches desperately for his long-lost pendant across space and time. Once the player obtains the pendant, Manus pulls them into the past. There, the player destroys the corrupted Artorias, and defeats Manus, halting the spread of the Abyss.\\n\\n==Development and release==\\n{{Expand section|date=August 2016}}\\n\\n''Dark Souls'' was developed by [[FromSoftware]], with series creator [[Hidetaka Miyazaki]] leading the project's development.\\n\\nFollowing the game's release for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, many gamers expressed their hope for a PC version.
