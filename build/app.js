She named the album ''Debut'' to signify a start of something new. ''Debut'' had a mix of songs Björk had been writing since she was a teenager, as well as more recent lyrical collaborations with Hooper. Although the music was mostly dance-oriented, it was varied in instrumentation. One single from the album, \\\"[[Venus as a Boy]]\\\", featured a [[Bollywood]]-influenced string arrangement. Björk covered the jazz standard \\\"[[Like Someone in Love]]\\\" to the accompaniment of a harp, and the final track, \\\"The Anchor Song\\\", was sung with only a saxophone ensemble for accompaniment.\\n\\nAt the [[1994 Brit Awards]], Björk won the awards for [[Brit Award for International Female Solo Artist|Best International Female]] and [[Brit Award for International Breakthrough Act|Best International Newcomer]].<ref>[http://www.everyhit.com/awardbrit.html The Brit Awards]. everyHit.com.

Building on the success of ''Debut'', Björk continued to pursue different sounds, taking particular interest in [[Dance music|dance]] and [[techno]].

During production, Björk decided the album would work best as an entirely vocal-based album. This initial plan was modified, as the majority of the sounds on the album are indeed created by vocalists but several feature prominent basic electronic programming, as well as the occasional musical instrument. Björk used the vocal skills of [[Inuit throat singing|throat singer]] [[Tanya Tagaq]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] [[beatboxing|beatboxer]] [[Rahzel]], Japanese beatboxer [[Dokaka]], avant-rocker [[Mike Patton]], [[Soft Machine]] drummer/singer [[Robert Wyatt]], and several [[choir]]s.

At the time, ''Medúlla'' became her highest charting album in the US, debuting at number 14.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/bjork/chart-history/top-album-sales/song/460561|title=Björk Medulla Chart History|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-03-04}}</ref>\\n\\nIn August 2004, Björk performed the song \\\"[[Oceania (song)|Oceania]]\\\" at the [[2004 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|Opening Ceremony]] of the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in [[Athens]].

This, however, has sometimes led to the lack of acknowledgment of auteurship in her music, something Björk attributes to being a woman. She has discussed this in a 2015 ''[[The Pitchfork Review]]'' interview:\\n<blockquote>If whatever I'm saying to you now helps women, I'm up for saying it. For example, ''Vespertine'', I did 80 percent of the beats on that album and Matmos came in right at the end. […] They are credited ''everywhere'' as having done the whole album. […] I spend 80 percent of the writing process of my albums on my own. I write the melodies—I'm outside. I'm by the computer, I edit a lot. That for me is very solitary, and I enjoy it a lot. […] The 20 percent of the album process when I get in the string orchestras, the extras, that's documented more.

If you make a film, you don't make a film about a film, you make a film about real life. And you wouldn't sit down and write a book about a book, it's like recycling, it misses the point.

''Debut'' had a mix of songs Björk had been writing since she was a teenager, as well as more recent lyrical collaborations with Hooper. Although the music was mostly dance-oriented, it was varied in instrumentation. One single from the album, \\\"[[Venus as a Boy]]\\\", featured a [[Bollywood]]-influenced string arrangement.

This, however, has sometimes led to the lack of acknowledgment of auteurship in her music, something Björk attributes to being a woman. She has discussed this in a 2015 ''[[The Pitchfork Review]]'' interview:\\n<blockquote>If whatever I'm saying to you now helps women, I'm up for saying it. For example, ''Vespertine'', I did 80 percent of the beats on that album and Matmos came in right at the end. […] They are credited ''everywhere'' as having done the whole album. […] I spend 80 percent of the writing process of my albums on my own. I write the melodies—I'm outside. I'm by the computer, I edit a lot. That for me is very solitary, and I enjoy it a lot. […] The 20 percent of the album process when I get in the string orchestras, the extras, that's documented more.

If you make a film, you don't make a film about a film, you make a film about real life. And you wouldn't sit down and write a book about a book, it's like recycling, it misses the point.

''Debut'' had a mix of songs Björk had been writing since she was a teenager, as well as more recent lyrical collaborations with Hooper. Although the music was mostly dance-oriented, it was varied in instrumentation. One single from the album, \\\"[[Venus as a Boy]]\\\", featured a [[Bollywood]]-influenced string arrangement.

This, however, has sometimes led to the lack of acknowledgment of auteurship in her music, something Björk attributes to being a woman. She has discussed this in a 2015 ''[[The Pitchfork Review]]'' interview:\\n<blockquote>If whatever I'm saying to you now helps women, I'm up for saying it. For example, ''Vespertine'', I did 80 percent of the beats on that album and Matmos came in right at the end. […] They are credited ''everywhere'' as having done the whole album. […] I spend 80 percent of the writing process of my albums on my own. I write the melodies—I'm outside. I'm by the computer, I edit a lot. That for me is very solitary, and I enjoy it a lot. […] The 20 percent of the album process when I get in the string orchestras, the extras, that's documented more.

If you make a film, you don't make a film about a film, you make a film about real life. And you wouldn't sit down and write a book about a book, it's like recycling, it misses the point.

''Debut'' had a mix of songs Björk had been writing since she was a teenager, as well as more recent lyrical collaborations with Hooper. Although the music was mostly dance-oriented, it was varied in instrumentation. One single from the album, \\\"[[Venus as a Boy]]\\\", featured a [[Bollywood]]-influenced string arrangement.

This, however, has sometimes led to the lack of acknowledgment of auteurship in her music, something Björk attributes to being a woman. She has discussed this in a 2015 ''[[The Pitchfork Review]]'' interview:\\n<blockquote>If whatever I'm saying to you now helps women, I'm up for saying it. For example, ''Vespertine'', I did 80 percent of the beats on that album and Matmos came in right at the end. […] They are credited ''everywhere'' as having done the whole album. […] I spend 80 percent of the writing process of my albums on my own. I write the melodies—I'm outside. I'm by the computer, I edit a lot. That for me is very solitary, and I enjoy it a lot. […] The 20 percent of the album process when I get in the string orchestras, the extras, that's documented more.

If you make a film, you don't make a film about a film, you make a film about real life. And you wouldn't sit down and write a book about a book, it's like recycling, it misses the point.

''Debut'' had a mix of songs Björk had been writing since she was a teenager, as well as more recent lyrical collaborations with Hooper. Although the music was mostly dance-oriented, it was varied in instrumentation. One single from the album, \\\"[[Venus as a Boy]]\\\", featured a [[Bollywood]]-influenced string arrangement.

This, however, has sometimes led to the lack of acknowledgment of auteurship in her music, something Björk attributes to being a woman. She has discussed this in a 2015 ''[[The Pitchfork Review]]'' interview:\\n<blockquote>If whatever I'm saying to you now helps women, I'm up for saying it. For example, ''Vespertine'', I did 80 percent of the beats on that album and Matmos came in right at the end. […] They are credited ''everywhere'' as having done the whole album. […] I spend 80 percent of the writing process of my albums on my own. I write the melodies—I'm outside. I'm by the computer, I edit a lot. That for me is very solitary, and I enjoy it a lot. […] The 20 percent of the album process when I get in the string orchestras, the extras, that's documented more.

If you make a film, you don't make a film about a film, you make a film about real life. And you wouldn't sit down and write a book about a book, it's like recycling, it misses the point.

The first was fellow Icelandic musician, [[Ólöf Arnalds]], who is also a member of Icelandic [[folktronica]] band [[múm]]. In 2006, Arnalds released her debut solo album ''[[Við Og Við]]'' in Iceland, which Björk citied as one of her favourite recent new acts of the last few years during a radio interview, and encouraged One Little Indian Records to reissue the album in the UK and Europe in 2009. On the same radio show for the American NPR channel, Björk also praised the works of emerging English artist [[Micachu]] and the more obscure, [[Omar Souleyman]]. Björk later used her official website to host the premier of [[Micachu]]'s debut video on the [[Rough Trade Records]], \\\"Turn Me Well\\\".<ref>[http://bjork.com/news/?id=947;year=2009 björk.com/news 2011].
